### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is a filter list you can import into a browser that supports it like Brave, or adblocker
copy the url from web3privacy as RAW and use it.

What it does?

Protects IP from being send to a bad actor which we seen on those false P2E games that has malware in it, or those fake scam mint websites
it does also block telegram/discord message/webhooks ( Prevents a bad actor getting info ) and much more...

Some of you have heard about monkeydrainer, currently its blocking all sites.

And also it does stop them from collecting info on your assets = No info collected they will not know what to steal from you.

See this as a 3rd layer defense if your extensions fail this should protect in some cases, on the other side it does have more privacy protection
than known web3 protection extensions out there.

This is BETA, do not think its a bullet proof solution, it does not require any other extension installed to work.
Filter can be easly disabled / enabled through settings on your browser.

Suggestion example, get Brave browser, create a profile install metamask and use burner account, 
put the list under settings>shields>content filter>Add custom filter lists>URL from github web3privacy as RAW.

uBlock: Settings>Filter List>Custom>Import>URL TO GITHUB

- ill try update everytime its needed, which should auto apply through the url from github.

Tested on: Brave, uBlock.
