### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#############################################################################

UPDATE:
I made two configs
anti-monkey does only target monkeydrainers 100% effective for now.

web3privacy is all around protection which already include anti-monkey.
#############################################################################

This is a filter list you can import into a browser that supports it like Brave, or uBlock
copy the url from web3privacy as RAW and use it.

What it does?

- Blocks info sending to badactor(Tg/Discord) âˆš
- Blocks known IP API  âˆš
- Destroys MonkeyDrainer âˆš
- Keep your assets private so a website can not lookup what you own âˆš

See this as a 3rd layer defense if your extensions fail this should protect in some cases, on the other side it does have more privacy protection
than known web3 protection extensions out there.

This is BETA, do not think its a bullet proof solution, it does not require any other extension installed to work.
Filter can be easly disabled / enabled through settings on your browser.

Suggestion example, get Brave browser, create a profile install metamask and use a burner account, 
put the list under settings>shields>content filter>Add custom filter lists>URL from github web3privacy as RAW.

uBlock(extension): Settings>Filter List>Custom>Import>URL TO GITHUB

- ill try update everytime its needed, which should auto apply through the url from github.

Tested on: Brave, uBlock.

- Please understand this is not a bullet proof solution and can break a website from working, there is no guarantee it will protect 100%
see this an extra layer of defense.
- This will not trigger any warnings or popup it is more a blocker.
